This project uses jCanvaScript.js to create graphics effects based on various polar equations, such as Archimedean spirals, Cissoids, Cochleoids, Conchoids, Lissajous curves, and Lituus Curves.

These code samples work in Webkit-based browsers on desktops, and will probably also work correctly on an iPad3 and Android ICS tablets.
